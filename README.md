# PyBer Analysis

## Project Overview

This project consisted of performing exploratory analysis of ride-sharing data for PyBer to provide data visualizations based on the realtionship between city types and fare costs to determine which neighbourhoods need to be funded to improve access to locals for ride-sharing services. 

## PyBer Analysis Results 

- The data reflects logical deductions of ride-sharing trends, the further you get from city centers the less accessible ride-sharing services become. It is evident through the data results that rural cities had the least number of rides with a total of **125** as compared to Suburban with a **625** and Urban with **1625**.

## Summary 

The code developed to run this analysis is a great and efficient tool for the election commission to analyze data sets of big scales, like this audit, the code is extremely customizable and can be easily run to analyze any data set by making small adjustments. The script can be applied to any electoral tabular dataset simply by changing the source of the data on the code itself, as can be seen in the screenshot below.
