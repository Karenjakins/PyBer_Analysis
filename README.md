# PyBer Analysis

## Project Overview

This project consisted of performing exploratory analysis of ride-sharing data for PyBer to provide data visualizations based on the realtionship between city types and fare costs to determine which neighbourhoods need to be funded to improve access to locals for ride-sharing services. 

## PyBer Analysis Results 

- The data reflects logical deductions of ride-sharing trends, the further you get from city centers the less accessible ride-sharing services become. It is evident through the data results that rural cities had the least number of rides with a total of **125** as compared to Suburban with a **625** and Urban with **1625**. The data also reflects that the costs of ride-sharing rises as the distance from the city center increases, which also impacts the number of Total Riders per city type and its accesibilty as only **78** people used ride-sharing services in Rural areas as compared to Urban areas with a total of **2405**. 

The results of the analysis can be reference on the table below:

The results of data are much easily understood with the graph below as it shows the disperaty of ride sharing services across the three different city types, and it clearly demonstrates what is most likely accessibility trends.

## Summary 

The code developed to run this analysis is a great and efficient tool for the election commission to analyze data sets of big scales, like this audit, the code is extremely customizable and can be easily run to analyze any data set by making small adjustments. The script can be applied to any electoral tabular dataset simply by changing the source of the data on the code itself, as can be seen in the screenshot below.
